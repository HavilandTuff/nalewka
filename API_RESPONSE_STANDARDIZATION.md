# API Response Standardization Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created API Utilities Module** (`app/api_utils.py`):
   - `success_response()`: Standardized success response format
   - `error_response()`: Standardized error response format
   - `paginated_response()`: Standardized paginated response format (for future use)

2. **Standardized HTTP Status Codes**:
   - Fixed `delete_api_key_endpoint` to return `204` (No Content) instead of `200` for successful deletions
   - Ensured consistent use of standard HTTP status codes:
     - `200` for successful GET and PUT requests
     - `201` for successful POST requests (resource creation)
     - `204` for successful DELETE requests (no content)
     - `400` for client errors (bad request)
     - `401` for authentication errors
     - `403` for authorization errors
     - `404` for not found errors
     - `500` for server errors

3. **Standardized Response Format**:
   - Success responses now consistently include data at the root level with optional message
   - Error responses consistently use `{"error": "message"}` format
   - Updated selected endpoints to use the new standardized format

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All API endpoints now follow the same response patterns
2. **Predictability**: Clients can expect the same structure from all endpoints
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized response handling makes future changes easier
4. **Standards Compliance**: Follows REST API best practices for HTTP status codes

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining endpoints to use the standardized response format
2. Add pagination support to list endpoints
3. Implement detailed error reporting with error codes
4. Add API documentation with examples for all endpoints
